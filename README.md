## OOP principles
+ **Encapsulation** : It's to hide the internal implementation details about the class (You can't access directly) like in Bank account system when you encapsulate the Balance to prevent any one from using it.
+ **Inheritance** : It allow you to create new classes based on another existing class and inherit all it's method and attributes but not the constructors it represents the Is A relationship which I used the most in this application.
+ **Polymorphism** : it's to treat the object as instance and it can be achived by override or overload.
+ **Abstraction** : You don't have to know the unneccessary details about the class you can define one class that shares the common behaviours of something and inherit from it and make sure that each abstract method or attribute should be overridden in the inherited class.
